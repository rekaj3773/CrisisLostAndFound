# Crisis Lost And Found
## Organize Lost and Found during a Crisis


*Another terrible story is unfolding of loss and grief.*  
*You click off the news.*  
*You close your eyes.*  
*You see mementos showing up miles away.*  
*You open your eyes and decide you are going to help.*  

### Starting a Lost and Found after a Crisis.
Use it as a 'How-to' guideline if you want to set up your own Lost and Found and help.

#### The Big Questions

##### Big question 1: Are you sure about this?
This commitment can take a lot of time.  Perhaps worse than trying to be helpful is being half helpful.  
If you are invested, you have to be all in.  Committing to a Lost and Found is not an opportunity for a photoshoot and pull out.

##### Big question 2: Are you going to travel to the location?

If you have been blessed with a schedule and situation that allows you to travel, consider it.
A central hub for lost and found is oftentimes the most useful tool.  Consider that at all major festivals you see a tent for Lost and Found. 
That said, you CAN organize a successful effort remotely.  

##### Big question 3: How will you store items?

Alluded to above, you may need to decide whether you will have a central location (like at a festival booth) a distributed model (like craigslist meetups all around the country)
If you are using a decentralized model, how will you ensure a transaction has been made?  Are you using scouts honor?  Are you asking that the receiver or giver contact you to confirm a success or failed transaction?

##### Big question 4: How will you track transactions?

In essense, you are bootstrapping together a sort of bank.  Do you want to track transactions on a yellow notepad?  Probably not.  But you don't need an enterprise database either.

Lucky for us, there is a tool that uses entries, sorts and organizes data that we use all the time.  It will work just fine.  It's called a spreadsheet.  I use Microsoft Excel.
If you don't have a Microsoft paid license, you can use the free tools LibreOffice Calc or Apache OpenOffice Calc.  I have used both in the past.  Both LibreOffice and OpenOffice each have a small learning curve, but are free and will work just fine.
Pro note: Most spreadsheets like excel have a row limit.  Excel is 2 million rows.  

##### Big question 5: Who is on your team?
Is it just you?  You might be in for more work than you expected.  And what do you do when you need a break but the show must go on?
Is it a team?  A team is helpful, but now you are a manager, adding in a whole new wrinkle.



#### Rules and Best Practices

##### Start with Actual Laws.
Now, we aren't lawyers here, so please do not take this as legal advice from law professionals.  Take any specific questions up with someone who has practiced law.
That aside, assuming you are in the US, the following is my best attempt to paraphrase and summarize the US federal laws:
>There exist three major categories of items;  *misplaced*, *abandoned* or **lost**.  
*Note: It is likely that noone is purposefully abandoning an item in crisis, and it is equally unlikley we have anyone placing an item down purposefully but forgetting the item.
Thus, for ease of assumption, we will consider all items in the 'lost' category. * 
>If an item is lost, the finder may make a claim to item that is only overruled by the true owner.  The goal is that a finder will give a reasonable effort to find a true owner.
Wikipedia gives a [good summary of the different types and history of the laws:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost,_mislaid,_and_abandoned_property)

Some states themselves have further laws on top of federal law.  Make sure to check on your State law to see any further codes.
E.g. Michican adds additional rule such as further breaks down item types to include (collectible currency, hazardous materials, etc.) and adds requirement to post on public forum any lost item in attempt to contact true owner before ownership is taken.

Some states (e.g. Florida) require that everything be reported to the local law enforcement. 

Make sure you know your laws.

if you're not in the US.  Please make sure you consult your national and local laws regarding this.
Individual states are different, like (example).
Make sure you know what your state will require you to do.

*Now the best practices.*

### Best Practices: How to make it even better

- Let the local authorities know what you are doing.
	In some cases this is required.  In all cases this is a good idea to foster a good relationship and promote co-operation.
	They may even ask for your help.  You want the proper permissions and permits if physically setting up shop, too.
	
- There will be spikes of activity. Here are a few times your lost and found will get hit hard:
    - After state of emergency is lifted (and people return to their homes for the first time)
    - After Electric is turned back on
    - After mobile tower service is restored

 **Where to set up:**  
- **Traveling to the affected location:**
    - Secure a location to store items in relative safety and security without breaking the bank.  Renting a box truck similar to one of these will suffice.  Dry, locks at night.  Scale as needed.
    ![Wikipedia Box Truck](https://github.com/rekaj3773/CrisisLostAndFound/blob/master/boxtruckwikipedia.jpg)
    - *Note: sometimes local storage companies are also inclined to help or partner.  They might offer you some steep discounts on storage trucks as a donation.  If so, take them up on their kindness and don't forget to mention their donation at every opportunity.*
   - Secure a location to set up shop.
     - Think twice about a spot before setting up shop.
     - You don't want to move lost and found as you might become part of what has gone missing.
   - Secure a shelter from the weather.  
     - A good pop up tent will do just fine.  Adjust for weather patterns in your area.
     ![Wikipedia Pop Up Tent](https://github.com/rekaj3773/CrisisLostAndFound/blob/master/popuptentwikipedia.jpg)
   - Secure a table and comfortable chairs.  
     - If all goes according to plan, you're going to be there for some time so get comfortable.
   - Consider lodgings.  
     - Are you in a cot at the Lost and Found site.  Probably not.  And please don't sleep in the truck.  The police and neighbors will get upset after a day or two of this.  
     - Your enthusiam for leading and continuing this Lost and Found effort must remain at a high.  Try to find lodgings nearby to sleep comfortably.
      - Important note: This may be VERY hard to come by as lodgings typically grow scarce during crisis.  Plan accordingly.  (I don't mind asking to borrow a camper and set up shop )
   - Consider having some water and/or other offerings donated.  
     - Many people have been through quite a lot, and even if you do not have their 
			missing item, a gesture or water can go a long way in unmeasurable conforting.
   - Consider getting postage donated
     - You might be able to send out some items to 
			people who have been displaced or traveled out of driving range
- **And/Or Setting up online:**
   - *Note: There are likely hundreds of acceptable ways to set up an online lost and found.*
   - You may want to balance ease of use/start up with cost.
   - A simple, clean, highly accessible mechanism is using Facebook.
   - Create a group on Facebook and have the Lost and Found Staff monitor and administer the page.  
   - Encourage communication and requests.  Use this as your central communications hub.
   - Feel free to advertise using low cost (like some Facebook advertising if you have the budget) or no cost mechanisms (like Craigslist posts) to point people to your Facebook page.
   - Create pictures of FOUND  items.  Create postings of LOST items.
   - Encourage friends to share.
		
	
- Determining what items to display: 
  - If you have a digital area to display items, digital space is usually not an issue.
  - If you have a physical space, you may have contraints on the amount of items you can display at a lost and found table.

  - Either way, you might carefully consider which items you wish to display.  It's probably not a good idea to post a picture of a lost hundred dollar bill.

  - Guideline: 
    - Look at each item.  Ballpark the item's value.  Greater than 50 dollars should be kept off a physical table and in locked storage.
    - Having a strategy for 'high ticket' items online will also reduce malicious claims. 
    - Not sharing that you have an items of high value might miss an opportunity to find an owner.  But sharing might invite trouble.
    - A good middle ground is to post or notate that you "Also have addition items of higher value.  Ask about them if you are missing something."
    - Make sure to get their identification and acceptable description of the item.  
      - It's a big, old painting (bad description, low percentage legitimacy).  It's a big painting with golden wood trim.  Not sure who painted it but it's of a park bench next to a stream" (good description, high percentage legitimacy)
      - *Note: Asking for a valid identification is one last deterrant if the person is trying to be malicious and the item is not theirs.*
    - Remember, not everyone is a saint but try not to assume the worst.
    - Truth is, at some point you will get something wrong and give away the wrong thing to the wrong person.  In general, sentimental things are often not targeted.  That means, reducing 

 - Finders' claims:
   - You will sometimes find a person who requests to keep the item in the case no owner is found.  This happens especially with cash or items of high monetary value. 
	  - Don't side eye them.  This is a perfectly fine request and encourages items to be turned in instead of pocketed unethically.
	  - Make sure to account for local laws about how long to keep an item before it is considered forfeit. (and perhaps add a little extra time for prosperity)
	  - Once the time has elapsed, you may log the requestor as the new owner, log the transactions and return it to them as new owner.

- Guideline of basic data to capture
  - When you get an item (item found) "I've found this":
	1. Name of item
	2. Descritpion
	3. Location found
	4. approximate time found
	5. Finder contact phone (optional)
	6. Finder contact email (optional)

  - When you get a request (add new lost item to DB) "I'm looking for this"
	1. Description of item.
	2. Approximate location thought to be lost.
	3. Reward offered? (x amount or anonymous)
	4. Finder contact phone (optional)
	5. Finder contact email (optional)
	
	
	This seemingly simple interaction can get rather complicated.  It may be easiest to view it on a diagram.
        ![Flowchart](https://github.com/rekaj3773/CrisisLostAndFound/blob/master/flowchartV1.png)
  


- Consider a disposal strategy.  
    - Look at everything twice.  Some things you get will be trash.  Other items may look like trash to you but may be a very special something for someone else.
	  - Having a guideline such as "Dispose of items as follows: Agreed by 2 or more staff as rubbish or unrepairable.  Estimated value at less than one dollar. Quality, poor."

 - Consider your end strategy.	
	 - At some point, you will need to leave.  You may get burnt out, you may have used up your vacation days at work or you may notice that the crisis is clearning.  
	 - You may feel bad.  But time well spent is worth the effort.  Time does help heal the hurt. It's time to discuss your exit game.
	 - Find a sponsor who will take the remaining items after you leave(even if you don't have one when you get started)
	 - Usually a written request and permission can be granted by a local civic organization such as YMCA.
	 - They may allow for any uncollected items to be held for extended duration, after you leave, before being donated or trashed.
